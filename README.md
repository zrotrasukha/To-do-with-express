# TODO APP WITH EXPRESS
This is a to do project with uses a json file to manage tasks, through it I am learning how express is used, so if you have any suggestions regarding the faults or increasing efficiency, do advice me , it will be appreciated! 

## To use this, follow these steps: 
1. Install npm with `npm i`
2. Install nodemon with `npm i nodemon`, it will help us watching changes in file, if made any. 
3. Use any web server interaction tool, like httpie, curl or Postman! (You do not have to use it right away). 
4. Initiate the `index.js` file with `nodemon index.js`. 
5. Add suffix the local host link, like `http://localhost:3000/`. The available suffix are these: 
  1. `/post` ; Method: `POST`
  2. `/update` ; Method: `PUT`
  3. `/getTask` ; Method: `GET`
  4. `/delete` ; Method: `DELETE`
